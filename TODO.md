a rough roadmap the way things stand.

- clean up the mess of definitions for the types (it's kinda mostly done)
- remove the `if` instead use `match` and `when`
  - keep something like `ternary` though
- remove the overload for `do` instead begin pipelines with `pipe` or some
- should drop the `for` instead approach the iteration through pipelines
- rewrite the guide in interactive edit mode (a single large example which we focus into every step)
- reorganize the tests
- use tags for tests
- type checking must be done within a single step
- support varargs
- we're missing coverage for `break`
- use `yo` and `pls` to start our pipelines now
- use `str` for values too
- require every call be clarified by using arguments by name
- should flip `Upwalker` now
- `yielding $param_name`
- improve the fucking logging yo
- begin bootstrapping. it is time.
- i kind of fucking hate `discovery.ts` stop passing those JSONs around... do validation, types
