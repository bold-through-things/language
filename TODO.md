a rough roadmap the way things stand.

- clean up the mess of definitions for the types (it's kinda mostly done)
- remove the `if` instead use `match` and `when`
  - keep something like `ternary` though
- remove the overload for `do` instead begin pipelines with `pipe` or some
- should drop the `for` instead approach the iteration through pipelines
- rewrite the guide in interactive edit mode (a single large example which we focus into every step)
- type checking must be done within a single step
- support varargs
- we're missing coverage for `break`
- use `yo` and `pls` to start our pipelines now
- use `str` for values too
- require every call be clarified by using arguments by name
- should flip `Upwalker` now
- `yielding $param_name`
- improve the fucking logging yo
- begin bootstrapping. it is time.
- i kind of fucking hate `discovery.ts` stop passing those JSONs around... do validation, types
- cannot be arsed right now. we need a good refactor of our call resolver. need to make it track the reason of each matching failure as it happens, not "infer" these reasons afterwards. so fucking stupid, what the fuck!
- generalize the fancy tests so that they furthertest a random passing test
