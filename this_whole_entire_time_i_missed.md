# a blatant better way of things!

why the **fuck** are we doing Python?!

we literally *need* the Deno either way. in Python, there is no typechecking lest you pull in malware via `pip`. so put the 2 and 2 together, what we get?

TypeScript!

confirm with `./test | tail -n 10` that all tests are passing. then translate the system. really, it is trivial. deliverables thus demanded:

- strictest mode we can establish!
- tests all pass by end of effort
- no `.py` files within the project
