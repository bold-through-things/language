# a blatant better way of things!

why the **fuck** are we in Python?!

it is time to make things Crystal clear!

confirm with `./test | tail -n 10` that all tests are passing. then translate the system. really, it is trivial. deliverables thus demanded:

- tests all pass by end of effort (`./test --backend-cr --e2e`)
- new directory, `compiler/src_cr`, which implements the full compiler
- no `.py` files within the project (except `./test`, we do not touch it!)
