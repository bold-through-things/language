# a blatant better way of things!

why the **fuck** are we doing Python?!

we literally *need* the Deno either way. in Python, there is no typechecking lest you pull in malware via `pip`. so put the 2 and 2 together, what we get?

TypeScript!

confirm with `./test | tail -n 10` that all tests are passing. then translate the system. really, it is trivial. deliverables thus demanded:

- strictest mode we can establish!
- tests all pass by end of effort (`./test --backend-ts --e2e`)
- new directory, `compiler/src_ts`, which implements the full compiler
- no `.py` files within the project (except `./test`, we do not touch it!)

got that? no, fuck all that.

# TypeScript is still not good enough. 

it is all optional and has no `int`. we're going with OCaml. 

no! OCaml?! no build system?! we are now going with a certain Crystal.

if i hear a single whine from you that "this is all complex" or "taking a long time" i will crash out i swear. i'm the one who's paying for these tokens. **burn them.** make it work. this is all trivial, you're not creating, just translating. what is your excuse?!
