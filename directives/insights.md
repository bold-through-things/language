# code insights extraction loop via interview.

here's our loop for current hour, Gemini. please follow these steps as outlined.

1. you read through a few files, whichever ones seem interesting to you. seek out peculiar decisions, suspicious code, and weird design. seek anything worth asking questions over.

2. ask me questions about it. i give answers. you decide then what's important and what's not and track important items via your context window. i will compress that context several times likely, so this is just instructions for compression, prioritize things that are actually *important*, and not the ones recent.

3. you repeat then from step 1.

my goal is to obtain insight into the codebase from your own perspective.
