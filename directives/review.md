# code review session seeking suboptimal implementations

if i am feeding you this file, then i would clearly like you to review the code. seek out and highlight obvious and better even not so obvious problems and issues in the code as it exists today. if simple fix, then we shall fix them here and now. if complex, i'll instruct you to leave a TODO comment.

speaking of, generally try to ignore the existing TODO comments. if there's a TODO, that means i am aware and will get to it eventually. this session is about discovering *new* issues. focus on the code, not on the comments.
