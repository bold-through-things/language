note Test WebSocket.send() union type support and EventHandler compatibility

fn message_handler
	param event
do
	note This function acts as an EventHandler
	do print
		string "Message received"

fn main_test
do
	note Create WebSocket instance
	do WebSocket as ws
		string "wss://example.com"
	
	note Test 1: WebSocket.send() with string (BufferSource | Blob | str union)
	do send
		get ws
		string "Hello WebSocket"
	
	note Test 2: WebSocket.send() with string variable
	local message
		type str
		string "Another message"
	do send
		get ws
		get message
	
	note Test 3: onmessage with bind construct (EventHandler compatibility)
	do onmessage in ws
		bind fn message_handler as callable
			_
	
	note Test 4: onopen and onclose also use EventHandler
	do onopen in ws
		bind fn message_handler as callable
			_
	
	do onclose in ws
		bind fn message_handler as callable
			_
	
	note If compilation succeeds, our WebSocket and EventHandler types work correctly
	note TODO: Add runtime test using Deno's bundled WebSocket server once we have proper Deno bindings generation

note Just test compilation, don't call main_test to avoid runtime issues
