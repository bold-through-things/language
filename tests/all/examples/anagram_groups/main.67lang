local input
	pls do stdin

local words
	pls do split the input
		string "\n"

local groups
	dict
		type named str for K
		type named list for V
			type named str

solution
	point loops each word
		pls get words
	pls do split the word
		string ""
	then do sort
	then do join as key
		string ""
	
	# TODO this really ought to be a macro. with(a groups key)do(if(self eq? null)then(self(list))) or something?
	#  well, that is still too verbose. perhaps something more like a groups key (executing if (self eq? null); list)
	#  which would be hilariously similar to a Python comprehension. lmfao. WHAT THE FUCK AM I COOKING ?!
	if
		pls do none?
			pls do has_keys the groups
				pls get key
		then
			pls do #
				pls get groups
				pls get key
				list
					type named str

	pls do #
		pls get groups
		pls get key
	then do push
		pls get word

solution
	point loops each group
		pls do values the groups
	pls do print
		pls do join
			pls get group
			string " "
