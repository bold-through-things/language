# what

a better programming language. the ones *you* made? all suck. this one? **doesn't.**

key features:
- targets the most powerful and contributed and researched and optimized runtime (wow, what a mouthful... i mean the V8 of course)
- actual semantic indentation?!
- (planned) custom macro expansion

name me a single other language that checks off those three boxes? Nim is the only one that gets close, but the JS support is secondary there.

extra key features:
- (WIP) strictest type checking
- trivial parsing unlocks powerful external codegen (i bet you could in `bash`...)
- clean and readable syntax without tedious punctuation overload
- (planned) custom syntax support for if you really must bring back your dreadful punctuation
- monadic (or so i've been told by the chatbots) field method `access` chains (what is a field but just a mere getter and setter?)
- (planned) **infinitely extensible macroprocessor with alternate backends**
- **focusing on expressiveness above all**
- (planned) **you get to redefine if** (why would you, what are you doing?!)
- **made not to sell but to be actually useful**
- **made not for you**
- **developed by somebody who actually cares**

and most importantly, perhaps?

**it's not snake oil, it's here now. the tests do all compile and run. you could build a webserver in it already if you so chose.**

# how

`./test.py` is the main entrypoint for you, at least for now. it runs all tests and also self documents the valid compiler usage and output execution.

# license

i will open source it all later, i haven't decided on the right license just yet

# our greatest enemy is our indifference.
