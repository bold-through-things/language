refactoring. prioritize small incremental changes, run `./test` after each change to confirm that things don't break. the code is quite complex and easy to break, and hard to fix afterwards.

my dear, please do identify your looping. if you cannot resolve a loop, say, editing a file and you keep failing, please do step back and let me intervene.

you seem quite eager to just guess what's wrong. sometimes it's obvious, but quite often not. do not be shy to debug things in detail.

build quality software and always remember. our greatest enemy is our indifference.
