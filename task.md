# WebIDL Integration Task Summary

## Goal

The primary goal of this task was to implement a pipeline to automatically generate Python code for WebIDL specifications, making them available as built-in functions in the 67lang compiler.

## Work Summary

1.  **Initial Exploration:** We started by searching for a pre-parsed JSON representation of the WebIDL specification. After some investigation, we found the `w3c/webref` repository, which contains the WebIDL spec in various formats.

2.  **Finding the Right Data:** The user guided us to the `curated` branch of the `w3c/webref` repository, where we found the pre-parsed WebIDL spec in JSON format in the `ed/idlparsed` directory.

3.  **Implementation:**
    *   We created a Python script, `compiler/src/webidl_importer.py`, which reads the JSON files from the `webref/ed/idlparsed` directory and generates Python code representing the WebIDL APIs.
    *   The generated code uses the `DirectCall`, `PrototypeCall`, and `NewCall` conventions already present in the compiler.
    *   The output of this script is a new file, `compiler/src/webidl_builtins.py`, which contains the generated built-ins.
    *   We modified `compiler/src/processor_base.py` to import the generated `webidl_builtins.py` file and merge the new built-ins into the compiler's list of built-in calls.

4.  **Testing:**
    *   We created a new test case in `tests/basics/webidl_api` to test the generated WebIDL built-ins.
    *   The test case uses the `URL` API, which is supported by the Deno runtime environment used for testing.
    *   We encountered and fixed several issues during testing, including syntax errors, incorrect macro handling, type mismatches, and git tracking issues.

## Work Summary (Continued)

5.  **Expanding API Coverage:** We decided to expand the API coverage to more WebIDL APIs. We started by improving the `webidl_importer.py` script.
6.  **Improved Type Handling:** We improved the `idl_type_to_67lang_type` function to use the IDL type names directly instead of relying on a hardcoded `TYPE_MAPPING`. This makes the importer more robust.
7.  **Optional Argument Handling:** We updated the importer to correctly handle optional arguments in constructors and methods, generating multiple overloads to accommodate different numbers of arguments.
8.  **Test Failure and Type System Limitations:** While testing the `TextDecoder` API, we discovered a limitation in the compiler's type system. The compiler is unable to resolve overloaded methods correctly when inheritance or union types are involved. This is causing the test for `TextDecoder.decode` to fail.

## Current Status

The `webidl_importer.py` script is now more robust and can handle optional arguments. The test for the `URL` constructor, which has an optional argument, is now passing during compilation. However, the test for `TextDecoder.decode` is still failing due to the type system limitations, and the overall test case fails due to a mismatch in the expected output.

After further investigation, we discovered that the root cause of the test failures is a deeper issue in the `Access_macro_provider`. The provider does not correctly handle chained method calls with arguments, leading to incorrect overload resolution. We have paused the effort to fix this to allow for more thought on the best approach.

## Next Steps

1.  Re-architect the `Access_macro_provider` to correctly handle chained method calls and argument passing.
2.  Continue with the type system implementation.

## Type System Fix Plan

1.  **Represent the type hierarchy:**
    *   Create a data structure to store the inheritance relationships between interfaces. A simple dictionary mapping a class to its parent would work.
    *   Populate this data structure by reading all the `.json` files in `webref/ed/idlparsed` and extracting the `inheritance` field.

2.  **Represent union types:**
    *   Create a data structure to store union types. A dictionary mapping the union type name to a list of its member types would work.
    *   Populate this data structure by parsing the IDL. Union types are defined with the `typedef` keyword or as part of an argument/return type.

3.  **Improve `_matches_signature`:**
    *   Modify the `_matches_signature` function in `compiler/src/macros/call_macro.py` to use the type hierarchy and union type information.
    *   When checking if an `actual` type matches a `demanded` type, it should not just do a string comparison. It should check if the `actual` type is a subtype of the `demanded` type (inheritance) or if the `demanded` type is a union that contains the `actual` type.
