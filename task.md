# WebIDL Integration Task Summary

## Goal

The primary goal of this task was to implement a pipeline to automatically generate Python code for WebIDL specifications, making them available as built-in functions in the 67lang compiler.

## Work Summary

1.  **Initial Exploration:** We started by searching for a pre-parsed JSON representation of the WebIDL specification. After some investigation, we found the `w3c/webref` repository, which contains the WebIDL spec in various formats.

2.  **Finding the Right Data:** The user guided us to the `curated` branch of the `w3c/webref` repository, where we found the pre-parsed WebIDL spec in JSON format in the `ed/idlparsed` directory.

3.  **Implementation:**
    *   We created a Python script, `compiler/src/webidl_importer.py`, which reads the JSON files from the `webref/ed/idlparsed` directory and generates Python code representing the WebIDL APIs.
    *   The generated code uses the `DirectCall`, `PrototypeCall`, and `NewCall` conventions already present in the compiler.
    *   The output of this script is a new file, `compiler/src/webidl_builtins.py`, which contains the generated built-ins.
    *   We modified `compiler/src/processor_base.py` to import the generated `webidl_builtins.py` file and merge the new built-ins into the compiler's list of built-in calls.

4.  **Testing:**
    *   We created a new test case in `tests/basics/webidl_api` to test the generated WebIDL built-ins.
    *   The test case uses the `URL` API, which is supported by the Deno runtime environment used for testing.
    *   We encountered and fixed several issues during testing, including syntax errors, incorrect macro handling, type mismatches, and git tracking issues.

## Current Status

The pipeline for generating WebIDL built-ins is now functional, and the test case for the `URL` API is passing. The `webref` directory, which was cloned to get the WebIDL data, has been removed to save space.

## Next Steps

When we resume, we can continue to expand the test suite to cover more WebIDL APIs and handle more complex scenarios.
