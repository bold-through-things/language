# WebIDL Integration Task Summary

## Goal

The primary goal of this task is to implement a pipeline to automatically generate Python code for WebIDL specifications, making them available as built-in functions in the 67lang compiler.

## Work Summary

1.  **Initial Exploration:** We started by searching for a pre-parsed JSON representation of the WebIDL specification. After some investigation, we found the `w3c/webref` repository, which contains the WebIDL spec in various formats.

2.  **Finding the Right Data:** The user guided us to the `curated` branch of the `w3c/webref` repository, where we found the pre-parsed WebIDL spec in JSON format in the `ed/idlparsed` directory.

3.  **Implementation:**
    *   We created a Python script, `compiler/src/webidl_importer.py`, which reads the JSON files from the `webref/ed/idlparsed` directory and generates Python code representing the WebIDL APIs.
    *   The generated code uses the `DirectCall`, `PrototypeCall`, and `NewCall` conventions already present in the compiler.
    *   The output of this script is a new file, `compiler/src/webidl_builtins.py`, which contains the generated built-ins.
    *   We modified `compiler/src/processor_base.py` to import the generated `webidl_builtins.py` file and merge the new built-ins into the compiler's list of built-in calls.

4.  **Testing:**
    *   We created a new test case in `tests/basics/webidl_api` to test the generated WebIDL built-ins.
    *   The test case uses the `URL` API, which is supported by the Deno runtime environment used for testing.

5.  **Type System Implementation:**
    *   We implemented a type system that understands inheritance and union types.
    *   We modified `compiler/src/webidl_importer.py` to extract type hierarchy and union type information from the WebIDL JSON files and store it in `compiler/src/type_hierarchy.py`.
    *   We modified `compiler/src/macros/call_macro.py` to use the type hierarchy and union type information to correctly resolve overloaded methods.

6.  **Fixing the `webidl_api` Test:**
    *   We fixed the `webidl_api` test case by updating the expected output and adding the expanded file to git.

## Current Status

The WebIDL integration is now working correctly. The `webidl_api` test case passes, and all other tests pass as well. The type system is now more robust and can handle inheritance and union types.

## Next Steps

Continue with the WebIDL integration, expanding the API coverage and adding more test cases.
