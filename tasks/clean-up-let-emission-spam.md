# Clean Up Let Emission Spam

## Priority
**MEDIUM** - Code quality improvement, blocked by pipeline syntax

## Problem
Generated JavaScript contains too many intermediate `let` declarations:
- Many intermediaries are irrelevant
- Creates verbose, hard-to-read output
- Performance implications

## Dependencies
**BLOCKED BY**: Pipeline syntax (`then` macro) implementation
- Pipeline syntax should eliminate many intermediaries naturally
- Must implement pipelines first to see remaining issues

## Solution Approach
After pipeline implementation:
- Analyze remaining unnecessary intermediaries
- Implement dead code elimination for unused `let` declarations
- Optimize variable lifetime analysis

## Complexity
May be trivial or impossible - won't know until pipeline syntax is complete.

## Impact
- Cleaner generated JavaScript
- Better performance
- More readable output for debugging
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
