# Error Handling: Try/Catch Support

## Priority
**MEDIUM-HIGH** - Essential for real-world usage

## Problem
No error handling mechanisms currently exist in 67lang.

## Solution
Implement basic try/catch macros that compile to JavaScript try/catch:
```
try
    # risky operation
    a might_fail
catch error
    a print
        string "Error occurred: "
        a error message
```

## Technical Details
- Map directly to JS try/catch blocks
- Simple 5-minute implementation
- Sufficient for MVP needs

## Future Considerations
- Lisp condition system for advanced error handling (long-term)
- Performance concerns with hidden context objects
- Restartable exceptions (low priority)

## Impact
- Enables robust error handling
- Required for production usage
- Foundation for more advanced error patterns
