# development notes and observations

## issues encountered during analysis

while working on this dogfood analysis, i encountered several things that could be improved in the project:

### documentation and discoverability

**test discovery confusion:**
- it wasn't immediately obvious how test discovery works
- had to read through `test.py` code to understand `tests.json` format
- would benefit from a simple example in the readme or docs

**language syntax examples:**
- the test files are great examples but scattered
- no single "language tour" or syntax reference
- had to piece together capabilities from multiple test files

**compiler architecture overview:**
- took significant digging to understand the processing pipeline
- the macro system is powerful but not well documented
- would benefit from architectural diagrams or high-level overview

### development workflow friction

**test runner verbosity:**
- lots of output during test runs (macro registration spam)
- hard to see actual test results among all the logging
- would benefit from quieter default mode

**error messages:**
- some compilation errors could be clearer
- position information sometimes missing or unclear
- stack traces show Python internals rather than language context

**file organization:**
- compiler source is well organized but could use more module documentation
- not always clear which module handles what functionality
- some utility functions scattered across multiple files

### language limitations discovered

**string handling gaps:**
- no escape sequence support mentioned in basics.ind comments
- limited string interpolation or formatting capabilities
- regex support exists but not well demonstrated

**collection operations:**
- basic list/dict operations work
- missing common operations like filtering, mapping, sorting
- would benefit from more functional programming utilities

**debugging support:**
- expand mode is great but not well documented
- logging is verbose but could be more targeted
- no clear way to debug user programs (vs compiler issues)

### potential improvements

**testing:**
- could benefit from unit tests for individual compiler components
- integration tests are good but component tests would help development
- performance benchmarking would be useful

**tooling:**
- language server mentioned but not well integrated
- syntax highlighting works but could be richer
- no code formatting or linting tools apparent

**documentation:**
- readme is colorful but could use more practical examples
- missing "getting started" tutorial
- no reference documentation for built-in functions

## positive observations

### what works really well

**test-driven development approach:**
- using tests as specification is brilliant
- real working examples show language capabilities
- comprehensive coverage of current features

**minimalist parser design:**
- tree_parser.py is indeed impressively minimal
- indentation-based syntax is clean and readable
- easy to understand and extend

**macro system foundation:**
- extensible architecture is well designed
- clear separation between processing phases
- good foundation for user-defined macros

**compilation pipeline:**
- logical flow from parsing to code generation
- good error handling and reporting
- metadata tracking system is clever

### architectural strengths

**python implementation quality:**
- clean, readable code throughout
- good use of dataclasses and type hints
- reasonable separation of concerns

**language design decisions:**
- semantic indentation is refreshing
- focus on browser/deno target is smart
- extensibility-first approach is forward-thinking

**development philosophy:**
- casual but professional approach works
- focus on utility over marketing is admirable
- dogfooding motivation is powerful

## recommendations for bootstrapping

### start with solid foundations
1. get file I/O working reliably first
2. implement module system early to organize code
3. focus on core standard library before advanced features

### maintain compatibility obsessively  
1. run both compilers in parallel throughout development
2. byte-for-byte output comparison where possible
3. comprehensive regression testing at each phase

### prioritize debugging facilities
1. good error messages are critical for adoption
2. macro expansion debugging will be essential
3. performance monitoring helps optimization

### plan for growth
1. design data structures for efficiency at scale
2. consider parallel compilation early
3. build extensibility into core systems

## overall assessment

this is a really interesting and promising project. the vision is clear, the technical approach is sound, and the implementation quality is high. the language already has enough functionality to be useful for real work.

the main gap for bootstrapping is infrastructure (file I/O, modules, standard library) rather than fundamental language limitations. the macro system and compilation pipeline provide a solid foundation for self-hosting.

the development approach - test-driven, incremental, focused on utility - is exactly right for a project like this. the casual but rigorous attitude creates a good environment for experimentation and iteration.

the biggest risk is scope creep - there are many tempting features that could distract from the core bootstrapping goal. staying focused on "what's needed to rewrite the compiler" rather than "what would be cool to have" will be critical for success.

this analysis suggests the bootstrapping effort is definitely feasible and likely to succeed if approached systematically. the 18-week timeline in the roadmap seems realistic for a motivated developer with good agentic coding tools.
