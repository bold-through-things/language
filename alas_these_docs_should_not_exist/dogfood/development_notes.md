# development notes and observations

## issues encountered during analysis

**documentation gaps:**
- test discovery mechanism not immediately obvious (tests.json format unclear)
- no single syntax reference - had to piece together from scattered test files  
- compiler architecture requires digging to understand processing pipeline

**development friction:**
- test runner very verbose (macro registration spam obscures results)
- error messages could be clearer with better position information
- file organization good but modules need more documentation

**language limitations:**
- string handling gaps (escape sequences, interpolation, formatting)
- missing collection operations (filter, map, sort)
- debugging support exists but poorly documented

## positive observations

**what works well:**
- test-driven approach using tests as specification is brilliant
- minimalist parser design (~100 lines, clean indentation-based syntax)
- extensible macro system with clear phase separation
- logical compilation pipeline with good metadata tracking

**architectural strengths:**
- clean Python implementation with good type hints
- semantic indentation and browser/Deno focus are smart choices
- extensibility-first approach provides good foundation

## recommendations

**bootstrapping priorities:**
1. file I/O reliability first
2. module system for code organization  
3. core standard library before advanced features
4. maintain compatibility obsessively with parallel testing

**key risks:**
- scope creep - focus on "compiler rewrite needs" vs "cool features"
- debugging facilities critical for adoption
- performance monitoring essential

## overall assessment

promising project with clear vision and solid technical foundation. main bootstrap gaps are infrastructure (file I/O, modules) rather than language limitations. macro system provides excellent self-hosting foundation.

18-week timeline realistic for systematic execution. biggest success factor will be staying focused on bootstrap requirements.
